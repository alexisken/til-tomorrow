This iOS application is a simple next-day reminder utility, with the intent to help quickstart your day at work.

While wrapping up a day of work, users can add of list of items they didn't quite get to and need to remember to do the following day.

The next morning, the app will automatically push the list of to-do items to the user when they approach their office's location.
